# Data Structures and Algorithms

This is my attempt on creating a source of content for those interested in learning the most basic data structures and related
algorithms that you would learn on the first years of a CS course.

One of my favorite languages out there is [Go](http://golang.org), so most of the implementations you will find here are in
in that language.

This is constantly a work in progress. I've being trying to add tests to most of the methods but the coverage is not 100%.
If you see any problems or have any suggestions on an algorithm you'd like to see here, feel free to create an issue.

# Recommended Literature

Most of the implementations you'll find here are based on:

* Cormen, Thomas H, and Thomas H. Cormen. Introduction to Algorithms. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2001.

Some other literature I recommend for those interested in learning more about data structures and algorithms:

* Sedgewick, Robert, and Kevin Daniel Wayne. Algorithms. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley, 2011.
* Skiena, Steven S. The Algorithm Design Manual. 2012.
